    body: |
        This dropdown selects which scenario of emissions (greenhouse gases, etc.) was used as an input to the model runs. The choices are the RCP 8.5 scenario (increase of greenhouse gas emissions until the end of the century) and the RCP 4.5 scenario (intermediate increase of greenhouse gas emissions peaking mid-century).

map-controls:
    title: Map Controls
    body: |
        These controls change which indicator data is displayed on the map. 
        The outermost set of buttons change the displayed climatology. There are four climatologies available: historical, early century, mid century, and end of century.
        The innermost set of buttons change the displayed timestamp for daily or monthly indicators. They are disabled for annual indicators.
        
model:
    title: Select Global Climate Model
    body: |
        This dropdown allows selection of the Global Climate Model (GCM) with which the indicator data was produced. The models are identified by short codes which are described in the Help.
